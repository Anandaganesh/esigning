					<h3>A.  PROMISE TO PAY</h3>
					<p class="promissory-txt" style="padding-bottom: 10px">This is a Master Promissory Note for one or more Loans. Each Loan made under the Master Promissory Note shall be subject to Aperture INC’ application process and will be used to finance a healthcare procedure. Each Loan that Lender may make, in its sole discretion, shall be made pursuant to this Master Promissory Note, shall incorporate by reference all of its terms, and shall be separately enforceable. At or before the time of each Loan’s disbursement, a Federal Truth In Lending Act Disclosure (“Disclosure Statement”) and a Loan Record will be provided that identifies the amount of the Loan and the Interest Rate applicable to that Loan. The interest rate applicable to certain Loans may be 0%. The Disclosure Statement will also include the Payment Schedule applicable to that Loan. The terms provided on the Disclosure Statement and Loan Record are incorporated herein by reference. I understand and agree that you will disburse the proceeds of each Loan only upon commencement of the applicable healthcare procedure and, if that procedure is not started within 30 days of the day that I sign its Loan Record, you will not make the Loan. I understand, however, that I may reapply for a new Loan in that circumstance. I understand that by accepting any disbursement issued at any time under this Master Promissory Note, I agree to repay the Loan associated with that disbursement. Based on information that you receive from my healthcare provider or otherwise I understand and agree that you may disburse a lesser amount than the amount I originally agreed to accept, up to the total principal sum of each Loan as identified on the applicable Loan Record.</p>
					<p class="promissory-txt" style="padding-bottom: 8px">To the extent disbursed, I promise to pay to you the total principal sum of each Loan, which includes amounts disbursed under the terms of this Master Promissory Note as well as each Disclosure Statement and Loan Record, the Origination Fee, if any, as defined below, interest, if applicable, (the “Interest Rate”) on such principal sum as provided on the Loan Record, plus returned payment fees, late charges and other fees, charges and costs as provided in this Master Promissory Note.
                  </p>
					<h3>B.  DEFINITIONS</h3>
					
					<ul  style="padding:0">
						<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">
							“Application” means the written, on-line (including mobile app) or oral (including telephonic) request that I make to you for a Loan.</li>
						<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">
							“Disbursement Date” means the date or dates on which you lend money to me pursuant to and in consideration for this Master Promissory Note, which will be the date of each Loan, electronic funds transfer, or other method you use to disburse loan proceeds to my healthcare provider when it submits an authorized transaction for payment through a card network.</li>
						<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">
							“Disclosure Statement” means the Federal Truth-in-Lending Disclosure that you will provide to me for each Loan.</li>
						<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">
							“Loan” means each principal sum that may be disbursed, as may be designated by you, plus interest on such principal sum, and other charges and fees that may be included or become due as provided in this Master Promissory Note.</li>
						<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">
							“Loan Record” means each promise to pay that I sign with respect to a particular loan that establishes the amount of the Loan, and the interest rate.</li>
						<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt"> 
						   “Master Promissory Note” means this agreement setting forth the terms applicable to each of my Loans originated under the Master Promissory Note. The term “Master Promissory Note” also includes each Application unless otherwise provided. </li>
						<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt"> 
						   “Payment Schedule” means, for each Loan, the number, amounts, and timing of payments scheduled to repay the obligation. This information is documented on and provided as part of the Disclosure Statement provided in conjunction with each Loan.</li>
						<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">
						 “Repayment Period” means, for each Loan, the period during which amortizing monthly payments of principal and interest are due and payable until the Loan is repaid in full. The Repayment Period begins on a Loan’s respective Disbursement Date and continues until the due date of the last payment shown in the Payment Schedule. Each Loan will have its own Repayment Period. </li>
					</ul>
					
				  <h3>C.  INTEREST</h3>
					<ul style="padding: 0">
						<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">  Accrual – If applicable, interest will begin to accrue as of the Disbursement Date on the principal amount of each Loan outstanding from time to time. Interest will be calculated on a daily simple interest basis by applying a daily interest rate to the outstanding principal balance each day of the term of each respective Loan. The daily interest rate will be equal to the Interest Rate in effect on that day, divided by 365.</li>
					<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">Interest Rate – The Interest Rate is identified in the Loan Record and will not increase or decrease over the life of my Loan. If at any time the Interest Rate is not permitted by applicable law, interest will accrue at the highest rate allowed by applicable law.</li>
					<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">Origination Fee - I agree to pay an Origination Fee, in the amount, if any, shown in the Disclosure Statement (“Origination Fee”). The amount of the Origination Fee will be determined based on a percentage, not exceeding 3.0% of the disbursed principal amount of each Loan. The Origination Fee will be added to the principal amount of the Loan on the Disbursement Date where it will accrue interest at the Interest Rate described above. I agree that the Origination Fee is fully earned by you when a Loan is disbursed. </li>
					<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">Annual Percentage Rate (“APR”) – The APR for my Loan is disclosed to me in the Disclosure Statement. The APR may be higher than the Interest Rate because the APR will include certain fees that may be charged for my Loan, as well as the rate at which interest accrues.</li>
                    </ul>
					<h3>D.  TERMS OF REPAYMENT</h3>
					<ul style="padding: 0px"><li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">Repayment Amount – I will make consecutive monthly payments during the Repayment Period on or before the due dates specified in each of my Payment Schedules, until I have paid all of the principal and interest and all other charges and fees payable under this Master Promissory Note. Each Loan will have its own Payment Schedule and its own repayment amount. The amount of the monthly payments will be determined at the time the Repayment Period begins to equal the amount necessary to amortize the disbursed and unpaid principal balance of each Loan in equal installments of principal and interest, if applicable, on the unpaid principal balance at the Interest Rate over the number of months in the Repayment Period. If the Loan is fully repaid and a credit balance remains, the credit balance will be refunded to me.  Any Addendum may provide for a different Repayment Period for a particular type of Loan.</li>
					<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">Amounts Owing at the End of the Repayment Period – Since interest, if any, accrues daily upon the unpaid principal balance of a Loan, if I make payments after my payment due dates, I may owe additional interest. If I have not paid my late charges or returned payment fees, I will also owe additional amounts for those late charges. In such cases, I promise to repay all amounts that I owe for each Loan and understand that, in your discretion you may increase the amount of my last monthly payment to the amount necessary to repay each Loan in full.</li>
					<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">  Payments – Payments allocated to each individual Loan will be applied first to returned payment fees, then to accrued interest, if any, then to principal, and the remainder to late charges and any other charges. Remaining amounts will be applied to principal.  </li>
					<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">  Other Charges – If any part of a monthly payment remains unpaid for a period of more than 5 days after the payment due date, I will pay a late charge equal to $14.99. I will also pay a returned payment fee of $9.99 for each payment that is returned for any reason.  </li>
					<li style="list-style-type:decimal; background: none; padding: 0px; margin-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px" class="promissory-txt">  Allocation of Payments Across Loans – If I have multiple Loans outstanding with the same payment due date, I will make one payment that you will apply to each Loan (a “Consolidated Payment”) as I may specify on the Aperture INC mobile app or in writing. If I do not give you specific instructions otherwise and my Consolidated Payment either exceeds or is less than the sum of my Loans’ monthly amounts due at the time payment is received, the Consolidated Payment or any part of the Consolidated Payment will be applied proportionally to each outstanding Loan based on the amount of each Loan’s monthly payment due, which includes any past-due monthly payments. If I make a Consolidated Payment that is returned, late, or is less than the sum of my Loans’ monthly amounts due at the time payment is received, you will assess the returned payment fee and late charge, described above in Section D.4, to the Consolidated Payment only once, apportioning the fee and charge across the applicable Loans. 
</li></ul>
					<h3>E.  RIGHT TO PREPAY</h3>
					<p class="promissory-txt">I have the right to prepay all or any part of a Loan at any time without penalty. If I prepay a Loan in full, l will not receive a refund of the Origination Fee, if any was charged in connection with the Loan. Any partial prepayment will be applied as in Section D.3 above and will not reduce the next payment due on a Loan. </p>
					
					<h3  >F.  DEFAULT AND REMEDIES</h3>
					<p class="promissory-txt">To the extent permitted by applicable law, I will be in default with respect to a Loan under the terms of this Master Promissory Note (subject to any applicable law which may give me a right to cure my default) if: (1) I fail to make a payment in full by the due date shown in a Loan’s Payment Schedule, (2) I break any of my other promises in this Master Promissory Note that materially impairs my ability to pay the amounts owed on that Loan, (3) any bankruptcy proceeding is begun by or against me, or I assign any assets for the benefit of my creditors, or (4) I make any false statement in applying for that Loan or at any time thereafter that materially impairs my ability to pay the amounts owed. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if I default on a Loan or Loans, I will be required to pay you the entire balance of my Loan(s) in full plus interest on the Loan or Loans accruing after its or their default. I also agree to promptly reimburse you, with interest, for all costs and expenses incurred in exercising your remedies related to this Master Promissory Note, including, where permitted by applicable law, reasonable attorneys' fees and the costs of collection after default. Your rights under this Master Promissory Note are cumulative and you may exercise these rights at any time if I default.</p>

Section K (Arbitration Agreement) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and not by any state law concerning arbitration regardless of my state of residence. If I am a resident of Colorado and the APR shown in the Disclosure Statement is greater than 21%, Colorado law will apply to the terms of my Loan except where Colorado law is preempted by federal law or federal law authorizes different terms.

You may delay, fail to exercise, or waive any of your rights on any occasion without losing your entitlement to exercise the right at any future time, or on any future occasion. You will not be obligated to make any demand upon me, send me any notice, present this Master Promissory Note to me for payment or make protest of non-payment to me before suing to collect on this Master Promissory Note if I am in default, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, I hereby waive any right I might otherwise have to require such actions.

					<p  class="promissory-txt"  style="padding-bottom: 10px">The Master Promissory Note (“MPN”) and the terms of this Addendum govern one or more Pay-in-4 Loans that I may obtain, but the Addendum shall govern with respect to any inconsistent terms. Except as noted in this Addendum, the provisions of my MPN are not changed. </p>
					<p  class="promissory-txt"  style="padding-bottom: 10px">Each Pay-in-4 Loan made under this Addendum shall be subject to Aperture INC’ application process and will be used to finance a healthcare procedure. Each Pay-in-4 Loan that Lender may make, in its sole discretion, shall be made pursuant to this Addendum and the MPN, shall incorporate by reference all of their applicable terms, and shall be separately enforceable. At or before the time of each Pay-in-4 Loan’s disbursement, a Disclosure Statement and Loan Record will be provided that identifies the amount of the Pay-in-4 Loan and the Interest Rate applicable to that Pay-in-4 Loan, which may be 0%. The Disclosure Statement will include the Payment Schedule applicable to that Pay-in-4 Loan. The terms provided on the Disclosure Statement and Loan Record are incorporated herein by reference. I understand that I can change my payment due date without a fee on one occasion. When not prohibited by State law, if I change my payment due date a second time, I will pay a change fee of $6.00. When not prohibited by State law, if any part of a scheduled payment remains unpaid for a period of more than 3 days after the payment due date, I will pay a late charge equal to $6.00. I understand that my first Pay-In-4 Loan payment will be due on the date that I sign the Loan Record. My Loan payments will generally be every fourteen days (“biweekly”) thereafter. I may change my first payment due, which may result in my second Loan payment being less than or more than fourteen days after the date of my first Pay-In-4 Loan payment. All of my subsequent Loan payments will be biweekly thereafter.</p>
					<h3 class="promissory-txt" style="padding-bottom: 5px">PROMISE TO PAY</h3>
					<p  class="promissory-txt" style="padding-bottom: 15px">I understand that by accepting any disbursement issued at any time under this Addendum, I agree to repay my Pay-in-4 Loan. I understand that I must use my debit card to make my first Pay-in-4 Loan payment at the time I sign the Loan Record and initiate payment and subsequent payments must be made either by debit card or ACH. If I do not then make my first Pay-in-4 Loan payment for any reason, I understand that my Pay-in-4 Loan will be cancelled and I will not be obligated to repay that Pay-in-4 Loan. Additionally, I understand that if my Pay-in-4 Loan is not funded within 30 days from the day that I sign the Loan Record, the Pay-in-4 Loan will be cancelled. I understand, however, that I may reapply for a new Pay-in-4 Loan in that circumstance.</p>
					<p  class="promissory-txt">I promise to pay to you the “Principal Sum” of each Pay-in-4 Loan, which includes the amount disbursed under the terms of the Loan Record and I promise to pay you any fees, including any returned payment fees, late and other fees, charges and costs as provided in this Addendum.</p>
